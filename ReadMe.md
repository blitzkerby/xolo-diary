## XoloNotes - A Simple Note Taking App

**XoloNotes** is a lightweight note taking application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and organizing your notes.

## Features:

- Create new notes with titles and content.
- Edit existing notes.
- Organize notes using a simple folder structure (optional).

## **Getting Started**

1. **Obtaining the Source Code:**

	- **Recommended:** Clone the repository using Git for a streamlined development experience and version control. Use the following command in your terminal:

```BaSH
git clone https://github.com/blitzkerby/xolo-diary 
```

**Alternatively:** Download the source code as a ZIP file directly from the repository or by forking the repository.

2. **Running the Application**:
 
	* Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
	- **Development Server Recommendation:** For a more convenient development experience, consider using a local development server like Live Server. This will automatically refresh the browser whenever you make changes to the code. Installation instructions for Live Server can be found on their website.

## **Using XoloNotes** 

- To create a new note, click on the "New Note" button. This will open a text editor where you can write your note title and content.
- To edit an existing note, click on the note title or its content area.
- You can optionally organize your notes using folders. The folder structure is currently implemented using client-side JavaScript, but note that this functionality is for demonstration purposes only and may not be fully persistent across sessions.

## **Further Development**

Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to customize the appearance and functionality of XoloNotes. Consider implementing features like:

- Persistent note storage (e.g., Local Storage, IndexedDB)
- Rich text editing capabilities
- Robust folder structure with drag-and-drop functionality
